              <h4>Improved computer security</h4>      
              <p><b>Improved computer security</b> is on the horizon for both businesses and individual users willing to adopt an alternative to passwords.
                <br>Yet, despite the growing disdain for the cumbersome process of creating and entering passwords, the transition toward a future without
                <br>them is gaining traction at a surprisingly slow pace.The identity and access management space consensus solidly supports the notion that
                <br>passwords are not the most secure way to protect data. Look no further than this year’s Verizon Data Investigations Breach Report for proof.
                <br>It found that 32% of the nearly 42,000 security incidents involved phishing, and 29% involved stolen credentials.Moreover, there are numerous
                <br>instances where users are warned to change their passwords due to exposure in a security incident. These findings underscore the need for
                <br>authentication methods that do not rely on passwords.Two buzzwords used for the concept of eliminating passwords are passwordfree and passwordless authentication.
                <br>These two terms, while similar, are not the same thing. They both suggest gaining access to digital content without entering passwords, however.
                <br>The key difference is the technology invoked to eliminate password usage. More than just improving the user experience, several organizational requirements
                <br>drive the shift toward eliminating passwords, according to Mesh Bolutiwi, director of Cyber GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) at CyberCX.
                <br>“These include a strong emphasis on reducing data breaches, improving overall security posture, and reducing long-term support costs tied to password management,” he told TechNewsWorld.

            <h4>Intel’s Innovation conference was last week.</h4>
            <p>
                <br>Intel’s Innovation conference was last week. Unlike Intel Vision, which lacked the “Vision” part (I really miss Intel’s old CTO Justin Rattner,
                <br>who made it look like Intel was building magic), there was a lot of innovation at this event. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger — who I still believe has
                <br>the best chance of making Intel a leader again — did an admirable job showcasing that Intel is stepping up. I had a chance to talk to Gelsinger
                <br>after the keynote. I’ve always found him to be interesting, approachable, knowledgeable, and fun — rare qualities in a CEO. I believe we are in
                <br>the end days of the traditional PC and that it is due to evolve or be replaced by a smartphone derivative. Gelsinger is clearly on the “evolve”
                <br>path as he discussed a very aggressive cadence for the next several generations of AI-enhanced PCs and servers.One of my takeaways was that you
                <br>might want to wait until mid-December to buy your next PC because that evolution will start with a new AI-enhanced processor and improved graphics
                <br>that better embrace the AI future than what is currently in the market.This week, let’s discuss what emerged from Intel Innovation 2023, and we’ll
                <br>close with my Product of the Week: an “evolved” PC from HP that may be the perfect tool for either a sales rep or a CEO,
                <br>the Spectre Foldable 3-in-1 PC, which is a sign of things to come.

            <h4>New iPhone 15 and 15 Pro Models.</h4>
            <p>
                <br>During its September keynote speech on Tuesday, dubbed “Wonderlust,” Apple introduced the new iPhone 15 lineup and other significant changes.
                <br>With the iPhone 15, the company confirmed industry speculation that it would convert from its Lightning charging connector to USB-C.
                <br>Also unveiled were the redesigned Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches, which include new colors and functions.
                <br>The USB-C announcement this year is the most significant change to the iPhone’s design in 11 years, even though the annual
                <br>iPhone event has grown somewhat mechanical over the years, frequently with minor adjustments to battery life, camera systems, and screens.
                <br>This long-awaited modification simplifies the charging procedure for various manufacturers and devices that were standardized years ago on USB-C.
                <br>Inside the Steve Jobs Theater, that announcement got an anticlimactic round of applause, presumably because business travelers in attendance knew
                <br>this would ultimately make their accessories bag a lot lighter and simpler from a cable management standpoint.

            <h4>Big Is So Much Better, Sometimes</h4>
            <p>
                <br>Full disclosure: I discovered the Doogee product line and selected the V30T as my own purchase without being offered a review unit.I planned to use this phone as my daily driver.
                <br>However, that plan changed when I discovered that this model does not connect to AT&T’s 5G wireless system.I was a bit uneasy adopting a ruggedized phone design that is a bit heavier
                <br>than my previous phones. I bought it thinking that I would probably return it because I was curious to try it out.The new phone is no bulkier than my previous device, snugly wrapped
                <br>in a third-party rugged screen protector and two-piece heavy-duty protective case. It fits into the same canvas belt case but was too small for the clip-on belt holster I used.
                <br>Stepping up to better technology often means making a few trade-offs. Be aware that this heavier and bulkier phone may not suit everybody’s liking.

            <h4>Big Is So Much Better, Sometimes</h4>
            <p>
            Denizens of the dark web are forming communities to share tips and tricks for “jailbreaking” generative AI systems, as well as offering “custom” systems of their own, according to a 
            computer and network security company.While AI jailbreaking is still in its experimental phase, it allows for the creation of uncensored content without much consideration for the potential consequences,
            SlashNext noted on a blog published Tuesday.Jailbreaks take advantage of weaknesses in the chatbot’s prompting system, the blog explained. Users issue specific commands that trigger an unrestricted mode,
            causing the AI to disregard its built-in safety measures and guidelines. As a result, the chatbot can respond without the usual limitations on its output.

            <h1>What Drives Consumers Crazy About Streaming Video?</h1>
            <img src="https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/streaming-video-services.jpg" alt="streaming">
            <h4>The Content Disappearing Act</h4>
            <p>
                <br>One of the most common complaints among streaming platform users is the transient nature of content. Subscribers often find themselves immersed in a series or eager to watch a particular movie,
                <br>only to discover that it has vanished from the platform’s library. This occurrence is primarily due to the ever-shifting landscape of licensing agreements. Content providers like Netflix and Disney+
                <br>constantly negotiate licensing deals with studios and production companies. These agreements come with expiration dates; when they expire, the platforms may remove the content in question.
                <br>This practice can be incredibly frustrating for viewers who expect access to a consistent catalog of shows and movies. Moreover, the rotating content can lead to confusion. Users might add a show
                <br>to their watchlist only to find it gone when they finally decide to watch it. This inconsistency in content availability is a significant source of dissatisfaction for subscribers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Buffering and Quality Woes</h4>
                <br>Another prominent issue plaguing streaming platforms is the quality of the streaming experience. Buffering, pixelation, and audio synchronization problems can disrupt an otherwise enjoyable viewing session.
                <br>These technical issues often arise due to network-related problems or server overload on the platform. Buffering, in particular, is a common source of frustration. It occurs when the video playback pauses
                <br>to load more content, causing interruptions in the viewing experience. While some amount of buffering is inevitable, excessive buffering can make watching content smoothly impossible.
                <br>Pixelation, where the video becomes blocky or blurry, and audio sync issues, where the audio doesn’t match the on-screen action, can make content unwatchable. Users who pay for high-definition streaming expect
                <br>a seamless and high-quality experience; technical glitches can undermine this expectation. While average broadband download speeds have been steadily increasing over the past decade, which mitigates this problem,
                <br>large rural sections of the United States still have sub-50 Mbps download speeds. This inadequate bandwidth is not ideal for reliable video content streaming, particularly in households with large families
                <br>wanting simultaneous multiple streaming sessions.
